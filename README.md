# ACCESSIBILITY

## Introduction to Web Accessibility

> Have you ever visited a website that seemed hard to use or navigate? Perhaps you couldn’t tell if an element was interactive or couldn’t read some of the text due to size issues. Chances are this has happened to you at least once, and it can be extremely frustrating. These problems that you encountered were likely the result of poor web accessibility.

> Web accessibility is one of those aspects of web development where its presence, when implemented correctly, goes unnoticed, but its absence can destroy the user experience. There are a variety of considerations to make when making a website accessible, ranging from the size and color of the text to invisible properties that are processed by assistive tools such as screen readers.

> Learning how to harness and apply the fundamental aspects of web accessibility should be a top priority for any developer looking to build an amazing, inclusive experience for all users.

## Hint

> While not an exhaustive list, some of the main accessibility issues are:

- Font size that is too small, making it hard to read.
- Text within paragraphs is too close together.
- Color contrast issues making it hard to discern text from the background.
- Abbreviations in the text that have no further context applied using the <abbr> element.
- Lack of interactivity indicators—no pointer cursor when hovering over interactive elements, links not underlined, etc.
- No print media query to allow for accessibility in print media
